# LibraryDatabase
These files are the main "points" of the Library Database project. There is a .window file with information about the window (GUI) made in NetBeans,
a .java file that has all of the code associated with the GUI, the SQL commands I used to create the tables in the database, and a picture of the schema used.
The picture was generated by MySQL Workbench.
